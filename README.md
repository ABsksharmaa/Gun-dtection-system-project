# Gun-dtection-system-project
 Developed a real-time gun detection system using computer vision techniques. The project leverages OpenCV to capture video feeds, process images, and detect objects (specifically guns) based on a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier. The application is intended for security purposes to detect firearms in a live environment and alert the user.
